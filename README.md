# Job Board Project In Python

This is basically just a project to show that I can actually build something and use it to solve my own problem.

I'm looking for jobs but don't want to go to each site everyday to check.

This app pulls and filters available job listings that I would be qualified for and puts them in a db

Will update readme as I build
